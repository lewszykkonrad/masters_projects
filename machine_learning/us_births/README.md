# Classifying births

In this repository you can find my project on classifying babies as healthy or non healthy based on their weight. If the weight fell into the interval where baby's weight was considered optimal, it was classified as healthy, otherwise it was classified as underweight or overweight. You can find the rmd output of the file in the link below:
